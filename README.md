# PyData Repository

Welcome to the PyData repository! This is my personal collection of Python projects, daily practices, and class exercises focused on data analysis, data science, and machine learning. Here, you'll find a range of materials—from introductory exercises to more advanced projects—all aimed at sharpening my skills in Python data handling.

## Introduction

This repository is a hub for all things related to my work and learning in Python data analysis. It includes:

- **Projects:** Full-scale projects ranging from data cleaning to machine learning models.
- **Exercises:** Practice exercises from class (like numpy-100 exercises, pandas tasks, etc.) that reinforce core concepts.
- **Daily Practices:** Code snippets and mini-exercises that I work on every day to keep my skills sharp.

## Projects

In the `projects/` directory, you'll find:

- Numpy Weekly Project


Each project comes with its own documentation and instructions on how to run the code.

## Exercises

The `practice.ipynb/` file contains various exercises that I complete as part of my coursework and self-study, including:

- Numpy exercises
- Pandas challenges


These exercises help me practice and apply new concepts in a hands-on way.

## Daily Practices

I push daily code snippets and practice exercises in the `week 'int'` directory. These are designed to:

- Explore new Python features or libraries
- Solve coding challenges
- Serve as a personal reference for future projects

## Technologies

This repository leverages several key Python libraries and tools, including:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Numpy** for numerical operations
